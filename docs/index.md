# Curate (a.k.a. Generalized TCR)

The Kleros-powered [TCR factory and browser](https://curate.kleros.io).

## Introduction

Curate is a web app built to ease interaction with Generalized TCR contracts. With it, users can create new TCRs (a.k.a. lists), browse deployed lists and interact with them (submit, remove or challenge items).

Decentralized curated lists are most useful as a replacement for apps that do curation without tripartition of powers. Some examples of apps that do this (and often generate frustation for users) are:

- Social Media;
- App Stores;
- News Platforms;
- Video Platforms;
- Content Storage;

The status quo is that central parties get to write the law (listing criteria), be the judge and enforce rulings on videos, posts etc. Using a Generalized TCR instead, allows these powers to be moved to the edges, such that the users of the app get to write the listing criteria and pick an arbitrator they consider to be neutral. Enforcing is done by the blockchain.
